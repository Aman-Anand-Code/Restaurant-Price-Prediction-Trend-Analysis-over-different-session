## 📌 Project Overview
- Collected and cleaned data from 22 restaurants in Bhubaneswar.
- Divided analysis into **seasonal segments (summer, winter, rainy)**.
- Extracted features from **dish names and ingredients using TF-IDF (NLP)**.
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to study seasonal pricing trends.
- Built and compared multiple **Machine Learning models** for price prediction.
- Best-performing model achieved **89% accuracy** (replace with your best accuracy).
- Generated actionable insights for seasonal menu pricing strategies.

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned missing values and duplicates  
   - Split data by **seasons (summer, winter, rainy)**  
   - Encoded categorical variables  

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - TF-IDF applied to dish names and ingredients  
   - Added seasonal dummy variables for trend capture  

3. **Modeling**
   - Compared models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and XGBoost  
   - Evaluated performance separately for each season  

4. **Evaluation**
   - Achieved highest accuracy of **89%**  
   - Visualized **season-wise price distributions** and predictions
